## TrueLibra

Facebook Libra on stable token. Soon on #Ethereum and #TRON.

### How does this work?

It's simple: 1 Libra = 1 trueLibra

We are working in an automated system to buy, sell and swap Libra to trueLibra.


### Why?

We want to decentralize the private and closed Facebook coin and what better than ethereum and tron network to tradear Libra in Dex exchanges with real smartcontracts

Sorry Mark, welcome to the crypto world.
